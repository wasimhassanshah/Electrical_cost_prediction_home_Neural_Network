Home Electrical bill and it's Forecasting using Neural Network
Data of my home electrical usage. Using those data I have used Neural Network on Time series data to find out the forecast of my cost for next 12 months, where we also tested the model with last 4 months original data.
I have used R programming Language and it's different packages, like tidyr, dplyr, forecast and dygraphs for visualization
